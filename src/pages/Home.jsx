        Dialectics is the law of movement, of what is. If we return to Hegelian idealism,
        the dialectic, far from being a static configuration or a deterministic conception,
        can be understood as ‘the configuration of the movement of the living’. Furthermore,
        dialectic negation is a process that is at the same time antithesis and synthesis.
        It is the constant creation of new forms. The negation of the negation (Hegel, 2011, 260)
        is precisely the process in which each form denies and eliminates the previous one and
        simultaneously generates a new form in reality. Therefore, negation is, in essence,
        creativity – unfinished creativity.&nbsp;Negativity’s end is not to negate, but rather it
        is immediacy and creativity. It is the engine of human activity in general. Engels wrote,
        ‘What, then, is the negation of the negation? An extraordinarily general law and, therefore,
        extraordinarily effective and important, which governs the development of nature, history and
        thought’ (Engels, 1975). And as far as we are concerned, we cannot escape the logic of the world,
        whose representation is our Reason. Human thought is singular and produces singular events
        (in the same way that the genetic code is singular and produces singular forms). Every second
        of every moment thought produces new forms in reality, and it is its radical singularity that
        resists the global annihilation of meaning. As Mallarmé says, ‘every thought throws
        a roll of the dice’, which marks the singular destiny of things. Human thought generates
        a new state of consciousness and a new understanding of reality since its light illuminates
        the colour of things. It is dialectical: it has in itself a negativity that always leads it to
        become another form. Thought always leads to something more. Thought is unfinished. Unfinished not
        because it lacks of, but because it is pure possibility.

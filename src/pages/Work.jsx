          In 2021, Mane Tatulyan founded M2-Systems™, a trademark of printed supplies for
          organization in the Digital Age. As both a philosopher (MA and PhD) and designer
          (BA), Tatulyan comprehended design as a way of ordering the world, and philosophy,
          as a way of understanding it. Design is, in a way, a humanist discipline, a radical
          singular practice that has been created by humans for humans. Even more, design can
          be understood, in a wider sense, as <i>applied</i> philosophy, as the concrete materialization
          of ideas in the world—a conception that was tested in its highest form under the principles of Modernism.
          <strong> In this context, M2-Systems™ was born at the intersection between philosophy
            and design as a continuation of the radical and universal ideas of global modernism.</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8">
          Modernity was, as Weber affirmed, a process of rationalization, a process of understanding the
          universal and rational structures that underlie the world. The element of ‘rationality’ makes Modernity
          a universal process, a structural development in thought that trascends space and time. This new vision
          shaped a new way of structuring, understanding, and signifying the world (and the human’s place in that
          world). <strong>More precisely, Modernity was the historical moment where the human being became aware
            of its condition as <i>Subject</i>.</strong> That is, the human finally recognized itself as the foundation
          of all things, as will, as representation, as form, as criticism, as autonomy, as freedom, and as reason.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8">
          In the aesthetic realm, modernists developed a radical yet timeless body of work. The modernists of the
          1950s were driven by the will to reconstruct and reorganize the world through design, through conceptually
          powerful systems that emphasized the social and humane responsibility of design. The creator, as the intersection
          between the material particular and the metaphysical universal, had the duty of materializing the spirit of the
          time by bringing new yet understandable and universal forms into the lifeworld. <strong>Continuing the rationalist
            heritage of their historical grandfathers, the socialist modernists unfolded a singular and colossal system of
            underlie and codifying the spirit of the early Modernist period. The aim was one: to decode the universal and
            rational structures that underlie the world. Thus, Modernism was always more than a form, it was a way of thinking
            and, ultimately, a way of being in the world.</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8">
          The discovery of the DNA of Modernity defines it as an epoch that shapes a very singular dialectics
          between the particular and the universal. As part of this immense Universal project, we belong to
          the whole in the same way that our cells are part of our organism; we are programmed according to
          our essence. Being a subsystem of the Universe, we are configured according to its image and likeness;
          hence, design is not an artificial discipline but a natural human activity. Actually, the most beautiful
          forces of design are to create and to organise. <strong>The pursuit of creating, systematizing, and
            organizing is to undertake a practice that belongs to our very spirit: we were designed (by a design) to
            design.</strong> The real is, intrinsically, a rational structure. And as far as we are concerned, we cannot
          escape the logic of the world, whose representation is our Reason.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8">
          However, the extreme nihilism of post-Modernity and the rise of anti-Humanism have opened up a world
          in which even the notion of the ‘Human’ is put in question by the new archeology of revisionism. All
          the energies of postmodernism are concentrated towards liquifying the Modern project —under a generlised
          amnesia that negates our roots to it. This is why today we must look back but with the eyes of our time,
          with the spirit of our time. <strong>Because when one says Freedom, Humanism, Progress, Critical Thinking,
            Autonomy and Reason, one says Modernity.</strong> We are successors of Modernity. In fact Modernity was not a
          historically situated doctrine but an attitude towards the world. To remember this legacy is to be able to
          think the future, to be able to build a meaningful system of tools for the future generations, to be able
          to overcome, as Vignelli said, ‘that disease that is called Postmodernity’. <strong>The multilayered
            physiognomy of Modernity has a rational yet revolutionary legacy —which is the radical, dialectical, and
            subversive side of Modernity.</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8">
          <strong>Looking back at the radical conquest of the Printing Revolution, M2-Systems™ exists exclusively
            with printed materials.</strong> Paper has always symbolized <i>possibility</i> and also <i>transcendence</i>.
          For centuries, the words of humans all over the world have survived and been passed on to us because of paper.
          Moreover, paper is a reminder: it is reminiscent of the human transformation of nature into something beyond
          the functional, into something meaningful and blossoming. To be in contact with paper not only connects us
          with nature but also connects us with <i>human</i> nature, as it represents the space for our creativity.
          <strong>Thus, through diverse systems of printed tools for the mind, M2-Systems™ continues this modern
            legacy and brings back the conception of design as a method of organizing the world to expand and democratize
            the humanist and universal DNA of Modernity.</strong>
